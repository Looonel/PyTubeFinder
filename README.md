This is a Python program made with the purpose of searching and downloading YouTube videos through your terminal. 
I made this program because I have to download tons of footage from YouTube for my editing but the MP4 downloading websites seem shady to me.
On top of that, there's too much ads before you could download.

This program fixes that problem, all you need to do is open this file through your terminal.
After that the program will give you a choice to search for a YouTube video or directly download a YouTube link that you've prepared.
